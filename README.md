# Causal Machine Learning for Coupon Campaign Optimization

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Double Machine Learning (DML) model designed to enhance the performance of a coupon campaign for a retail store. The model utilizes data sourced from Kaggle and is developed with the aim of improving the targeting and effectiveness of coupon distribution.

## Features

- **Double Machine Learning (DML):** The model employs a two-stage approach, predicting the likelihood of coupon provision in the first stage and estimating the impact on sales in the second stage, while addressing potential confounding factors.

- **Kaggle Dataset:** The data used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, providing valuable insights into customer behavior and coupon campaigns within a retail context. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vasudeva009/predicting-coupon-redemption/data) 

- **Coupon Campaign Optimization:** The primary goal is to optimize coupon distribution by identifying key factors that contribute to increased sales, ensuring a more efficient and targeted campaign.
